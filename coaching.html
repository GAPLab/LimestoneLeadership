                        <h2> <a name="CoachingRelationship"></a>The Coaching Relationship</h2>
                            <hr/>
<p>
Working together to help you make meaningful changes in your life. Sometimes these changes happen quickly, and other times more slowly. To build momentum, we start with a commitment of approximately 3 months. This allows the coaching relationship to develop, and if challenges arise, gives time to work towards a collaborative solution. 
</p>
 <p>                         
Our coaching relationship will be designed to serve your goals.  Your feedback is important because we will occasionally redesign how we collaborate, in order to optimize results.
</p>  
<p>                            
As your coach you can expect me to:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
  <li>View you as a naturally creative, resourceful and whole person.</li>
  <li>Be on time and prepared for regularly scheduled calls.</li>
  <li>Be transparent, honest, authentic, and hold your agenda as the primary focus of our working relationship.</li>
    <li>Take risks and ask difficult questions to further your growth, learning and development.</li>                            
</ul>
<p>As the client it is expected that you will:</p>	

<ul>
    
<li>Call at our scheduled appointment time at (613) 389-8951 OR arrive at our scheduled appointments. </li>
<li>Take a few minutes prior to your call (or face-to-face meeting) to focus on the upcoming session.</li>
<li>Call from a place where you are comfortable, can concentrate, and will not be disturbed or otherwise distracted for the scheduled length of your session.  Calling from a vehicle is not recommended as you may be asked to get up and walk around from time to time.</li>
<li>Be committed to making constructive changes in your work and/or life.</li>
<li>Have a focus or topic for every call or in-person session. Please bring your own agenda, wants, and needs to each session.</li>
<li>Be ready and willing to talk about yourself, recognizing that this time is completely dedicated to you, your growth, learning, and action.</li>  
</ul>
<p>Occasionally I will allow us to be in silence, even if it is a little uncomfortable, to allow you room to think, feel, and respond earnestly.  As the client, you will set the purpose for our regular sessions by selecting a topic for our discussion. At the beginning of each session we will spend some time discussing the topic you have identified to ensure we have a similar understanding of the subject of our call.</p>
                          
<h2> <a name="Confidentiality"></a>Confidentiality</h2>  <hr/>

<p>All of the information that is discussed is completely confidential and will never be shared with another person without your (the client’s) direct, written permission. The only exception to this agreement, would be if you are perceived to be a potential danger to yourself or another person in which case I am obligated by law to contact the relevant authorities. </p>

<p>Please be assured that our coaching relationship is confidential within the limits of the law as practiced in Ontario. I will not divulge to anyone that we are in a coaching relationship, and will not real any identifying content of our sessions to anyone. You are free to share whatever you choose from our sessions with anyone you like. Occasionally, I may record a session for the sole purpose of anonymous review with a master coach, in order to maintain the high standard expected of my professional association. For more information, visit <a href = "url"> www.coachfederation.org</a>
</p>
<p>
Professional coaching is the art and science of assisting healthy and effectively functioning individuals move forward and gain more meaningful and satisfying outcomes in their lives, careers, businesses and organizations. Coaching is not the practice of Psychotherapy. I am required by law in some jurisdictions to inform clients that they should have no expectation for a coach to provide any assessment or counseling to assist the client in understanding conscious or unconscious motivations; to resolve emotional, relationship, or attitudinal conflicts; or to modify behaviours that interfere with effective emotional, social, or intellectual functioning.
</p>
                            
 <p>My services are consultative in nature and you understand that decisions made and actions taken, based on input from or discussion with me, are ultimately your responsibility, and I have no liability or responsibility for any of your actions (or inaction) in connection with such services. I make no guarantees or warranties, expressed or implied, as to results to be achieved, or as to the consequences of actions taken or not taken by you. By beginning the coaching appointments, you and I agree to the contents of this letter. </p> 

<p>Most of us have a tendency to resist change. Even though you may feel committed to begin some changes, do not be surprised or discouraged if some resistance shows up a little while down the road.  This may appear in many forms including distraction, fatigue, doubt or anxiety. This sort of reaction is very common and can be taken as a positive sign. (You are probably on the verge of growing past some previous limitations.) If this should happen, simply lean into the support of the coaching process. There is great value in working through the difficult times. If either of us feel the need to improve this agreement (including our schedule), let’s establish a time to review the concerns, successes and desired changes, in order to create a satisfying resolution that honours you as client, me as coach, and our coaching relationship.</p>

<p>According to the International Coaching Federation (ICF) regulations, I am required to keep records of client’s names, contact information (email and/or phone) and hours coached.  Information about the content of the coaching is never shared in any way with the ICF credentialing committee.</p>

<p>More information on the ICF is available at: <a href="url">www.coachfederation.org</a></p>
